Word Classification and Machine Translation based on TensorFlow
===

## word2vec_implementation
* Implemented word2vec and skip-gram algorithms to generate word vectors for words from word dataset. 
* Visualized the word vectors distribution by dimensionality reduction using tSNE algorithm

## machine_translation
* Implemented seq2seq algorithm based on encoder-decorder layers assembled by LSTM Cells and English-French machine translation using TensorFlow
